- [x] DEV.md updated with Next.js/TypeScript best practices and CoinGecko API guidelines
- [x] PLAN.md created with detailed 12-week development roadmap
- [x] DEVLOG.md initialized for progress tracking

**üîß Technical decisions made:**
- **Tech Stack Selection**: Chose Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **UI Framework**: Selected shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for consistent, professional trading interface
- **API Strategy**: CoinGecko API with smart caching to stay within 10,000 monthly call limit
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight state management, TanStack Query for API caching
- **Charts**: TradingView-style charts for professional trading experience

**üöß Challenges identified:**
- **API Rate Limiting**: CoinGecko free tier limited to 10,000 calls/month (333/day)
  - **Solution**: Implement smart caching with 1-2 minute intervals, batch requests, fallback to cached data
- **Real-time Data**: Need to simulate real-time experience within API constraints
  - **Solution**: Optimized polling with WebSocket-like UX using TanStack Query

**üìä Project Scope Defined:**
- **7 Main Sections**: Dashboard, Trading, Markets, Portfolio, Wallet, News, Settings
- **Timeline**: 12-week development cycle with 6 distinct phases
- **Performance Goals**: <2s load times, 30s data refresh intervals
- **Coverage**: 9M+ cryptocurrencies with comprehensive market data

**‚è≠Ô∏è Next steps:**
- [ ] Request PostgreSQL database credentials from user (DATABASE_URL)
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript template
- [ ] Set up shadcn/ui and configure design system
- [ ] Implement CoinGecko API client with rate limiting
- [ ] Create basic layout structure and navigation

### 2025-01-18 - [Planned] Next.js Project Setup & Foundation
**üéØ Planned accomplishments:**
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and App Router
- [ ] Configure shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up project structure and basic routing
- [ ] Implement CoinGecko API client with rate limiting

**üîß Technical implementation plan:**
- **Project Structure**: Use Next.js App Router with organized folder structure
- **API Client**: Create reusable CoinGecko client with caching and error handling
- **UI Components**: Set up shadcn/ui with custom trading theme
- **Environment**: Configure development environment with proper TypeScript setup

**üìã Requirements needed:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection string (DATABASE_URL) from user
- **API Key**: CoinGecko API key (already prepared)
- **Domain**: Future domain configuration for production

**‚è≠Ô∏è Next steps after completion:**
- [ ] Create basic layout and navigation structure
- [ ] Implement dashboard page with market overview
- [ ] Set up real-time data fetching system
- [ ] Begin markets page development

## üìä Project Manager Integration Log

### Task Completion Tracking
**Track when you complete tasks from Project Manager**

- **2025-01-17**: Completed "Project Documentation Setup" - Created comprehensive documentation structure with README.md, DEV.md, PLAN.md, and DEVLOG.md
- **2025-01-17**: Completed "Project Planning" - Developed detailed 12-week roadmap with 6 development phases

### Database Queries Used
**Document useful SQL queries for this project**

```bash
# Get current high-priority tasks for CryptoNow
sqlite3 $PROJECT_MANAGER_DB "
  SELECT name, type, status, priority, description
  FROM ProjectItem pi
  JOIN Project p ON pi.projectId = p.id
  WHERE p.name = 'CryptoNow'
  AND pi.priority IN ('HIGH', 'URGENT')
  AND pi.status = 'TODO';
"

# Update task status to IN_PROGRESS
sqlite3 $PROJECT_MANAGER_DB "
  UPDATE ProjectItem
  SET status='IN_PROGRESS', updatedAt=datetime('now')
  WHERE name='Next.js Project Setup'
  AND projectId=(SELECT id FROM Project WHERE name='CryptoNow');
"
```
